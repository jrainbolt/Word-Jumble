/**
 This file contains some toy code which illustrate example
 usage of the standard template library unordered_map class
 among other things.  Some other C++ concepts illustrated
 include:
 
 the std::sort function
 command-line arguments
 opening and reading from files
 the "foreach" construct to iterate over elements
 in an STL "container"
 
 The program itself reads a text file and builds a
 "frequency-count" data structure using an unordered_map.
 
 For each ditsinct string in the input file, the map
 keeps track of the number of time that string appears
 in the file.
